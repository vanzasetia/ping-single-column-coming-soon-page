## Overview

### Introduction

Welcome to the `README.md` of this repo! The purpose of creating this project is to sharpen my coding skill.

In this file I'm going to tell you everything, starting from tools that I used, and much more.

That's it for the introduction and **happy reading!**

### The Challenge

My challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an input field
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
